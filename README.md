### Description
 Here is how the app works:

   * The game begins when the player clicks the start button.  
   
   * After clicking the start button, the game timer starts, and the player has 15 seconds to answer the question being displayed.
        
   * If the player fails to answer the question in the alotted amount time, or answers incorrectly, the question will be marked as wrong.  Likewise, If the player answers correcty, the question will be marked as such.  Either way, the game will continue until the player has had a chance to answer all of the trivia questions.  

   * The correct answer will be displayed in the event the player answers incorrectly or runs out of time.

   * At the end of the game, the player will be shown his or her score, and will be given the opportunity to restart the game and try again.  To give it another shot, the player can press the button labeled: Try Again.
